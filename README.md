Following tutorial https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step

Used different datasets:

Meteorite data set- multinomial classification. ~45k rows - some visualisations and algorithm evaliation is heavy and slow.
Red Wine quality data set- Regression analysis. ~1.6k rows
